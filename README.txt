The idea of the projhect is to take an FFT of a signal and show to outpu of the FFT on a LED array/screen.

First im going to generate a signal with the DAC and try to use the ADC at the same time and take an FFT of the signal.
After this is done, i will try to use a AUX as signal input. 

What is done:
	- Generated a signal with the DAC.

TODO: 
	- Use the ADC to read the signal and do an FFT.
	- Visualize the FFT?
	- Show the FFT results on LED arrays.
